\subsection{Co-optimisation Across Regulation and Contingency FCAS}
Section \ref{sec:coop_method} explored the co-optimisation of energy and regulation participation, however did not encompass all 9 NEM markets, that is, inclusion of the contingency markets. Although contingency payments events occur rarely, and as such don't dictate BESS dispatch directly, any generator providing contingency must have sufficient headroom and capacity in order to provide the service. Furthermore, the FCAS enablement payments are also dependent on the droop setting of the BESS in addition to the required frequency response \parencite{AEMO_Droop}.
