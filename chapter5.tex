\chapter{Co-optimised Energy Arbitrage with Regulation Participation}
\section{ Methodology }
\section{ Analysis }
\subsection{  Impact of Energy Throughput During Regulation Participation }
\subsection{ Impact of  Contingency Revenue }
\subsection{ Validation of Existing Asset Performance  }
\textbf{Method}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Run Co-optimised Regulation and Energy Arbitrage Model Over Historic Data
  \item Run Energy Only with Perfect Foresight over historic data
  \item Run Energy Only Imperfect Foresight Model with Bid Model over Historic Data
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Adjust Bid Model to Ensure Reasonable annual energy throughput. 
   \end{itemize}
  \item Find the Discount Factor i.e 40\% of Imperfect Foresight with Bid Model and Throughput Constraints and Apply to Co-optimised Revenue to Approximate Historic Asset Performance. 
  \item Compare and Justify Differences
\end{itemize}
