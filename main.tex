\chapter*{Abstract}
On March 9th, 2017 Elon Musk made a bold bet to the South Australian Government, Tesla will install a 100MW battery in less than 100 days, or else it is \textit{free}. This monumental twitter bet caught the attention of tech billionaires, media and politicians, generating polarising discussion on the value of utility scale energy storage in Australia. Against the odds, on December 1st 2017, French renewable energy developer, Neoen officially deployed the Hornsdale Power Reserve, otherwise known as ``The Telsa Big Battery''. Utility energy storage is not a new phenomenon, pumped hydro electric storage has been installed across the world on a GW scale for decades. So how has the established world of energy policy excited the twitterverse? 
\newline
\newline
The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) has undergone an rapid transformation over the last decade. Influx of low-cost solar and wind projects, combined with ageing thermal generation and residential solar photovoltaic uptake have increased spot market volatility. This volatility is driving the requirement for dispatchable capacity. Utility-scale battery storage is widely viewed as being a key enabling
technology that is likely to play a critical role in
ensuring the provision of a secure and reliable
electricity system in a future of high penetration
variable renewable energy. Although utility battery storage is in its infancy, the role which it can assume has an incredible degree of flexibility, offering services including load shifting, frequency stability, voltage support, in addition to backup power services. The notion of `revenue stacking' explores how simultaneous provision of these services can be administered to maximise value in accordance with operational strategies.
\newline
\newline
This thesis explores the base revenue stream of energy arbitrate under optimal operation, and highlights the driving forces which have yielded annual revenue increases with over 3-fold improvements since 2013 in particular NEM regions. Comprehensive exploration of energy arbitrage has been evaluated with the inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, confirming that South Australia offers the best value for utility battery storage, and suggesting that 2 hours of storage is the optimal size for utility battery energy storage systems (BESS). Insights into the changing generation mix in the NEM are also offered, highlighting that a continual increase in Solar PV penetration in South Australia may result in a 20\% degradation in revenue. This thesis examines the impact of the NEM bidding process and highlights how arbitrage value can be realistically captured via a competitive bidding process in the NEM, an area which has never been assessed under a NEM context. The final aspect of this thesis is analysis into co-optimisation across energy and regulation markets. The approach undertaken employs a linear programming technique. The co-optimisation approach undertaken validates the revenue generated by Hornsdale over calendar year 2018, and serves as a powerful tool for assessing BESS revenue under varied market conditions.
\newline
\newline
The work undertaken in this thesis is both valuable from an academic perspective but also serves significant value from a commercial context with the potential to forecast future revenue, validate historic asset outcomes and devise operational strategies for utility storage. To ensure this value reaches the hands of engineers focused on the future energy mix of Australia, some algorithms have been make open source available at:

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I would like to thank Daniel Tam who co-authored this body of work with me. Dan's excellence in algorithm design and computer science has really served the foundation for a considerable portion of this thesis. Throughout the thesis, myself and Dan have shared a common mindset, and have efficiently divided workflows to yield results we're pleased to share. I personally apologise to Dan for my poor use of JIRA and merge conflicts in the git repository, but I will hope you will forgive me in the future. 
\newline
\newline
To the team at Infigen, your support has been tremendous and I am saddened that the completion of this thesis marks the end of my journey at this company. To Merrick, thanks for your guidance and enthusiasm for our project. To Tahlia and Gerry, thanks for always offering time to discuss the complicated operation of the Australian electricity market. Your experience clarified a lot of questions, and your advice was always incredibly valuable. To the legends in the OCC; Steph, Jordan, Jack, and Carlos, thanks for all taking the time to help me with pieces of analysis or just facilitating fantastic banter on a Friday.
\newline
\newline
To Jiefei Wang, I am very grateful for you providing us with your thesis and providing the foundation from which we validated our original results. To Nick Gorman, thank you for your work in creating open source tools, in particular NEMOSIS. Thank you for also taking time to discuss our data related queries. 
\newline
\newline
Finally to Anna and Iain, thank you for facilitating our unorthodox partner project. I really appreciate you both making the time to discuss this project in your incredibly busy schedules. I'm looking forward to extending this analysis in the future and discovering how we might be able to contribute to the existing literature.
